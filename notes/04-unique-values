unique ID => when storing data each data entry should have at least one unique value.
generate unique and random string
auto incrementing integers

primary_key must always be unique
`AUTO_INCREMENT` is an attribute like DEFAULT `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
`SERIAL` data type is an int which is auto incremented. (AUTO_INCREMENT is only used by mysql, but serial is available on both postgres n mysql)
using SERIAL in mysql will result in an BIGINT instead of an INT
