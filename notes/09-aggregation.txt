COUNT() => return number of values in a group of values
SUM() => find a sum of a group of numbers
AVG() => find the average of a group of numbers
MIN() => return the minimum value from a group

COUNT() gotcha => total COUNT
null values are not counted and are ignore so to get real count, we usually use primary key/unique identifier or COUNT(*)
